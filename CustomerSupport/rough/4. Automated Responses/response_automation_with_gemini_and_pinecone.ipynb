I ordered a refrigerator from your website, but it was delivered in parts by different sellers, and I'm facing difficulty in assembling it.\\n\\nAgent: I'm sorry to hear that. May I have your order number, please?\\n\\nCustomer: Yes, it's BB987654321.\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for providing that information. Let me check your order details. Could you please hold for a moment?\\n\\nCustomer: Okay, I'll hold.\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for waiting. I'm sorry for the inconvenience caused. I understand that you are facing difficulty in assembling the refrigerator. Is that correct?\\n\\nCustomer: Yes, that's right. I received the parts from different sellers, and I'm not sure how to assemble them.\\n\\nAgent: I see. We do offer clubbing orders from different sellers for combined delivery to save shipping costs. However, I understand that it may cause inconvenience to customers. Let me check if we can arrange for an expert to assist you in assembling the refrigerator. Could you please hold for a moment while I check?\\n\\nCustomer: Okay, I'll hold.\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for waiting. Unfortunately, we don't have an expert available for assembling the refrigerator. However, I can assist you in troubleshooting the issue. Do you have the user manual with you?\\n\\nCustomer: Yes, I do.\\n\\nAgent: Great. Please refer to the user manual and let me know which part you are facing difficulty in assembling.\\n\\nCustomer: It's the freezer compartment.\\n\\nAgent: Okay. Let me check the user manual.

It also has diagrams to help you understand the process. Would you like me to guide you through the process?\\n\\nCustomer: Yes, please.\\n\\nAgent: Okay. First, you need to attach the rails to the freezer compartment door. Then, you need to slide the freezer compartment onto the rails. Once it's in place, you need to secure it with screws.

Why didn't it apply to my purchase?\\n\\nAgent: I'm sorry for the confusion. It's possible that the sale price did not apply to your purchase because the sweatshirt might not be eligible for the sale price. May I ask if you have added any other items to your cart?\\n\\nCustomer: No, I only added the Grey Hooded Sweatshirt to my cart.\\n\\nAgent: I see.
