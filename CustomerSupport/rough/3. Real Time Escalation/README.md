# Issue Escalation Module

## Overview
The Issue Escalation module is a key part of the Customer Support Ticket Analysis and Prevention System. It identifies tickets requiring manual intervention based on specific keywords and rules. Tickets flagged by this module are forwarded to a human agent, bypassing automated responses, ensuring high-quality resolution for critical issues.

## Importance
In customer support, some issues require human intervention due to their complexity or sensitivity. The Issue Escalation module ensures that such tickets are identified and prioritized for manual handling, enhancing customer satisfaction and maintaining service quality.
